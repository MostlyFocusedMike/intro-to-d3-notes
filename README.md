Notes for SVG and D3 from frontendmasters

This is the main course notes https://observablehq.com/@sxywu/introduction-to-svg-and-d3-js. They are hosted on an Observable journal. Basically it's Jupyter Notebooks if it were entirely web based and built for JS. Also, the cells are not automatically top down, you can specify dependencies of the cells and put all your require statements at the bottom of the page.
